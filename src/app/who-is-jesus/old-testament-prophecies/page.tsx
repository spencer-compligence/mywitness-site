            &quot;Mighty God,&quot; &quot;Eternal Father,&quot; and &quot;Yahweh Our Righteousness.&quot;

          <ScripturePassage
            reference="Isaiah 9:6"
            title="The Child Who Is 'Mighty God'"
            text="For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; and the government will rest on His shoulders; and His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace."
            whyItMatters="The Hebrew term for 'Mighty God' is El Gibbor (אֵל גִּבּוֹר). This is the same title used for Yahweh Himself in Isaiah 10:21. A mere created being cannot be called 'Mighty God' or 'Eternal Father.' This prophecy declares that the coming Messiah would be God incarnate."
            nwtNote="The NWT renders this identically, making it difficult for JWs to explain how a created being could bear these divine titles."
          />

          <ScripturePassage
            reference="Isaiah 7:14"
            title="Immanuel: 'God With Us'"
            text="Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin will conceive and bear a son, and she will call His name Immanuel."
            whyItMatters="'Immanuel' literally means 'God with us' (Hebrew: עִמָּנוּאֵל). Matthew 1:23 explicitly applies this prophecy to Jesus. The name itself declares that in this child, God Himself would dwell among humanity."
          />

          <ScripturePassage
            reference="Micah 5:2"
            title="The Ruler Whose Origin Is 'From Everlasting'"
            text="But as for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you One will go forth for Me to be ruler in Israel. His goings forth are from long ago, from the days of eternity."
            whyItMatters="The phrase 'from the days of eternity' (Hebrew: מִימֵי עוֹלָם) indicates the Messiah's eternal pre-existence. Only God is eternal. This prophecy was fulfilled in Jesus' birth in Bethlehem (Matthew 2:1-6)."
          />

          <ScripturePassage
            reference="Isaiah 40:3"
            title="Prepare the Way for Yahweh"
            text="A voice is calling, 'Clear the way for Yahweh in the wilderness; make smooth in the desert a highway for our God.'"
            whyItMatters="All four Gospels apply this passage to John the Baptist preparing the way for Jesus (Matthew 3:3; Mark 1:3; Luke 3:4; John 1:23). The one whose way John prepared is explicitly identified as 'Yahweh' and 'our God' in the original prophecy. Jesus is Yahweh."
          />

          <ScripturePassage
            reference="Psalm 45:6-7"
            title="The Father Calls the Son 'God'"
            text="Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; a scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom. You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness above Your companions."
            whyItMatters="Hebrews 1:8-9 explicitly quotes this psalm and applies it to Jesus. God the Father addresses the Son as 'God' (Hebrew: אֱלֹהִים, Elohim). This is the Father's own testimony to the Son's deity."
          />

          <ScripturePassage
            reference="Psalm 102:25-27"
            title="The Eternal Creator"
            text="Of old You founded the earth, and the heavens are the work of Your hands. They will perish, but You will endure; and all of them will wear out like a garment; like clothing You will change them and they will be changed. But You are the same, and Your years will not come to an end."
            whyItMatters="This psalm is addressed to Yahweh (see v. 1, 12). Yet Hebrews 1:10-12 applies these exact verses to Jesus the Son. The writer of Hebrews, under inspiration, identifies Jesus with the Yahweh who created the heavens and earth and who is eternally unchanging."
          />

          <ScripturePassage
            reference="Isaiah 44:6"
            title="The First and the Last"
            text="Thus says Yahweh, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, Yahweh of hosts: 'I am the first and I am the last, and there is no God besides Me.'"
            whyItMatters="In Revelation 1:17-18 and 22:13, Jesus claims to be 'the First and the Last' — the same title that belongs exclusively to Yahweh. If there is 'no God besides' Yahweh, and Jesus shares this unique title, then Jesus is Yahweh."
          />

          <ScripturePassage
            reference="Zechariah 12:10"
            title="Yahweh Says 'They Will Look on Me Whom They Have Pierced'"
            text="And I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn."
            whyItMatters="Yahweh Himself is speaking ('I will pour out... they will look on Me'), yet He says He will be pierced. John 19:37 applies this prophecy directly to Jesus' crucifixion. Yahweh was pierced at His death."
          />

          <ScripturePassage
            reference="Jeremiah 23:5-6"
            title="'Yahweh Our Righteousness'"
            text="Behold, days are coming,' declares Yahweh, 'When I will raise up for David a righteous Branch; and He will reign as king and act wisely and do justice and righteousness in the land. In His days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely; and this is His name by which He will be called, 'Yahweh our righteousness.'"
            whyItMatters="The coming Messianic King — the 'righteous Branch' from David's line — is given the divine name Yahweh Tsidkenu (יְהוָה צִדְקֵנוּ), meaning 'Yahweh Our Righteousness.' This is not merely a descriptive title but the very name of God applied to the Messiah. A created being cannot bear Yahweh's own name as his personal name."
            keyPoints={[
              "This strongly complements Isaiah 9:6 — the Messiah is called both 'Mighty God, Eternal Father' and 'Yahweh Our Righteousness'",
            ]}
          />

          <ScripturePassage
            reference="Daniel 7:13-14"
            title="The Son of Man Receives Divine Worship"
            text="I kept looking in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven One like a Son of Man was coming, and He came up to the Ancient of Days and was presented before Him. And to Him was given dominion, glory and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations and men of every language might serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion which will not pass away; and His kingdom is one which will not be destroyed."
            whyItMatters="This prophecy is foundational to understanding Jesus' identity. In the Old Testament, riding on clouds is exclusively a divine prerogative (Psalm 104:3; Isaiah 19:1). The Aramaic word 'pelach' used for 'serve Him' is used throughout Daniel exclusively for religious worship of deity. An eternal kingdom belongs to God alone."
            keyPoints={[
              "'Coming with the clouds of heaven' — Only God comes on the clouds in the Old Testament",
              "'All peoples... might serve Him' — The Aramaic 'pelach' means religious worship of deity",
              "'His dominion is an everlasting dominion' — An eternal kingdom belongs to God alone",
              "Jesus identified Himself as this 'Son of Man' over 80 times in the Gospels",
              "At His trial, Jesus quoted this passage — the high priest tore his robes and declared it blasphemy because he understood Jesus was claiming to be the divine figure of Daniel 7",

              Written centuries before Jesus was born, these 10 Old Testament prophecies
              consistently identify the coming Messiah as God Himself. He would be called
              &quot;Mighty God,&quot; &quot;Eternal Father,&quot; and &quot;Yahweh Our Righteousness.&quot; He would
              receive divine worship from all nations. He would be pierced — yet He is
              Yahweh speaking. The evidence is clear: the Messiah was never expected to be
              a mere created being.
